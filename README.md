# Bizcardx--extracting_data_using_OCR

About the project Youtube-Data-Harvesting-And-Warehousing: This project mainly focuses on fetching the data available in the Business Card. This is achieved by OCR technique. ( optical character recognition ). The collected data is stored in MySQL(sql database) for better categorisation and easier assessibilty of data. Using Streamlit, the collected data is user interfaced and frameworked. Thus any data can be deleted or modified.

# TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:

STREAMLIT: Streamlit library was used to create a user-friendly UI that enables users to interact with the programme and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.

PYTHON: Python is a powerful programming language renowned for being easy to learn and understand. Python is the primary language employed in this project for the development of the complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualisation.

OCR: Optical Character Recognition is the library used to scan the semi-structured data (most of the times an image) and convert it to structured data (mostly a binary).

MySQL: MySQL is an open-source, advanced, and highly scalable relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its reliability and extensive features. It provides a platform for storing and managing structured data, offering support for various data types and advanced SQL capabilities.

# SIGNIFICANCE OF OCR : 

The main benefit of optical character recognition (OCR) technology is that it simplifies the data-entry process by creating effortless text searches, editing and storage. OCR allows businesses and individuals to store files on their computers, laptops and other devices, ensuring constant access to all documentation.

The benefits of employing OCR technology include the following: 
                                                      Reduce costs
                                                      Accelerate workflows
                                                      Automate document routing and content processing
                                                      Centralize and secure data (no fires, break-ins or documents lost in the back vaults)
                                                      Improve service by ensuring employees have the most up-to-date and accurate information
